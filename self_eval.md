# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
*I feel really confident in the function of each one and when to use them. I still find myself looking back at the lesson frequently to reference if the = sign goes first or last in a "greater than or equal to" conditional.*

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
*My confidence is really strong when understand the functionality of the logical operators and when to use them. I do, for some reason, have a hard time typing || on my keyboard, always seem to get a wrong key in there somewhere.*

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
*Again, confidence is strong when it comes to writing if statements; a little less strong when reading an existing if statement and trying to decipher what the story is. The bear story took some time for me to figure out but I really enjoyed the mental space trying to work through the logic of the code*

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
*I probably took 2 hours total on this lesson, my pairing session came up right as I was approaching the CFU. I had to back track a bit and re-read some of the documentation a second time to make sure I was using the correct operators. I thought this was going to be one of the longer sessions based on the cloned repo but I was able to work through it confidently*

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
*I want to spend some time before mod 1 practicing logic questions and becoming more accustom to the mind set required during that type of thought. I plan to review other if statements that I find online and work through them to better understand the code. I feel confident right now in the conditionals section and will not adjust my calendar for this lesson specifically.*  

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
*I would be curious to know what the best practice is when approaching a if statement? Do you read the entire code block first and try to make sense of it? Is it best to run the code and see what the output is? Do you read the questions first and try to segment it for simplicity? This will most certainly be a topic in my small group stand up in the morning.*
